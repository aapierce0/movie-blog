Imagine if someone 

The Room is a very strange movie. The acting is bad, the writing is also bad. There's an extended sex scene 10 minutes in, and the footage from that scene is clearly re-used in a later sex scene with the same two characters. There are entire side-plots that don't go anywhere. You should watch this movie.
